                <h1>Gaba</h1>
                <h4>(Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)</h4>
                <p>Gamma aminobutyric acid or (GABA) is a naturally occurring amino acid that works as a neurotransmitter in your brain. Neurotransmitters function as chemical messengers. GABA is considered an inhibitory neurotransmitter because it blocks, or inhibits certain brain signals and decreases activity in your nervous system.</p>
                <br>
                <p>GABA’s big role in the body is to reduce the activity of neurons in the brain and central nervous system, which in turn has a broad range of effects on the body and mind, including increased relaxation, reduced stress, a more calm, balanced mood, alleviation of pain, and a boost to sleep.</p>
                <br>
                <p>GABA’s natural calming effect on the brain has led to countless claims about the use of GABA supplements to reduce stress. Too much stress is linked to poor sleep, a weaker immune system, and a higher risk of depression and anxiety.</p>

                <h1>Sam-e</h1>
                <h4>(S-Adenosyl Methionine)</h4>
                <p>SAM-e is a compound produced naturally by the human body. It acts on a number of important molecules including hormones, neurotransmitters, fatty acids, DNA, proteins and cell membranes. When used as a supplement it can enhance mood, brain and neural function, joint health and liver detoxification.</p>
                <br>
                <p>SAM-e has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties. Low levels of SAM-e have been observed with various diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's and liver disease. Since its side effects are less than those of many antidepressants, Sam-e may be tolerated better by most.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Many studies show that SAM-e helps relieve the pain of osteoarthritis and well as benefits in the treating of fibromyalgia. SAM-e is not found in food and if not produced naturally, strongly encouraged to take in supplement form.</p>

                <h1>Ashwagandha</h1>
                <h4>(Withania Somnifera)</h4>
                <p>commonly referred to as Indian ginseng. It is classified as an adaptogen, meaning that it can help your body manage stress. Ashwagandha is one of the most important herbs in Ayurveda, a form of alternative medicine based on Indian principles of natural healing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Used for more than 3,000 years to relive stress, increase energy levels and improve concentration. Many of its health benefits are attributed to its high concentration of withanolides, which have been shown to fight inflammation and tumor growth as well as powerful effects on some male reproductive health.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Research has shown that it promotes antioxidant activity that protects nerve cells from harmful radicals. Protecting against harmful radicals has been shown to improve brain function, including concentration, memory and mental health.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to write review for this product because I rarely take medication and rarely get anxiety. I’m a diver so getting anxiety underwater is no fun and dangerous. Last time I got anxiety I took these pills and by the time I got to work it was gone. I highly recommend these pills if you suffer from anxiety.</p>

                    <img class="stars" src="images/stars.png" alt="">
                    <p>My wife ordered this for me as I have tried gaba already. A Friend recommended I take Ashwaganda together and found it under gaba combo. I have been taking it 2x a day on an empty stomach - once in the morning and once more around mid-day. After about 2 weeks, I can say it works a lot better now that I am pairing it with gaba. This will help you with maintaining energy levels and anxiety throughout the day dealing with stressors. Hopefully, they will have a monthly subscription discount, as I bought it at full price.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been taking this supplement for 30 days now and I can attest to the benefits advertised by this product. I used to take Lexapro to help with my depression, after 5 years of taking Lexapro (and a few years of grief counseling) I felt like I was ready to stop taking medication. I was able to function and feel like myself again until my life went sideways several months ago. I found myself in a dark place again and contemplated going back on antidepressants, until I started taking ReformGSA. I now feel like a weight has been lifted and I’m not only able to function, I want to be present again! I’m starting my second bottle and can’t wait to disclose how things progress for me! 😊</p>

                    <p>I wanted to write review for this product because I rarely take medication and rarely get anxiety. I’m a diver so getting anxiety underwater is no fun and dangerous. Last time I got anxiety I took these pills and by the time I got to work it was gone. I highly recommend these pills if you suffer from anxiety.</p>

                    <p>My wife ordered this for me as I have tried gaba already. A Friend recommended I take Ashwaganda together and found it under gaba combo. I have been taking it 2x a day on an empty stomach - once in the morning and once more around mid-day. After about 2 weeks, I can say it works a lot better now that I am pairing it with gaba. This will help you with maintaining energy levels and anxiety throughout the day dealing with stressors. Hopefully, they will have a monthly subscription discount, as I bought it at full price.</p>

                    <img class="stars" src="images/stars.png" alt="">
                    <p>I’ve been taking this supplement for 30 days now and I can attest to the benefits advertised by this product. I used to take Lexapro to help with my depression, after 5 years of taking Lexapro (and a few years of grief counseling) I felt like I was ready to stop taking medication. I was able to function and feel like myself again until my life went sideways several months ago. I found myself in a dark place again and contemplated going back on antidepressants, until I started taking ReformGSA. I now feel like a weight has been lifted and I’m not only able to function, I want to be present again! I’m starting my second bottle and can’t wait to disclose how things progress for me! 😊</p>

                    <p>I’ve tried everything, even prescription drugs for anxiety and stress. This works better than anything I’ve tried, along with St. John’s Wort. The combination is amazing!!!! I feel like a different person!!!</p>
